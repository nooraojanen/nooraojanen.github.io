        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>In the summer of 2019 WIMMA Lab's team called Overflow was working on Ehasa's situational awareness system for airsoft games. Ehasa's current system is used to create and manage their airsoft games, but it lacks some features.</p>
        <p>The challenge was to address the issues with the present Ehasa system, and implement an upgraded version with new features, like real time player tracking and using a map to give tactical plans to the players.</p>
        <p>I was part of their team to design the new interface and create a logo for the system. The new system was named as TACS. TACS comes from the words Tactical Airsoft Command System.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Background</h2>
    <p>In the summer of 2019 I was working as a Junior Designer trainee in Wimma Lab, which is a two and a half year long project camp in which students of JAMK University of Applied Sciences participate in as trainees. Students solve challenges given by partner companies, research programs, or universities. Depending on the project subject, the goal is to develop production-ready solutions or concept conversions.</p>
    <p>I was part of a team called PengWin Media. The mission was to produce high quality graphics and visualizations for other teams working at WIMMA lab. My work tasks included web development, UX/UI Design, updating social media, photography, digital marketing, SEO and facilitation. </p>
    <p>I worked with team Overflow as a designer to help with their Ehasa project.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge was to address the issues with the present Ehasa system, and implement an upgraded version with new features, like real time player tracking and using a map to give tactical plans to the players.</p><br/>
    <h4>My goals were to:</h4>
    <p>1. Design a logo which reflects to the system</p>
    <p>2. Design some interface screens and improve site features</p>
    </div>

<div class="container">
    <h2 class="title">Solution</h2>
    <p>The situational awareness system was developed as a scalable cloud service, using serverless technology, that can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    <p> The service was developed as an independent system from the current one, although it is used as a reference. Players’ phones will be used to track them during the game so team leaders can give them tactical plans by drawing figures on the map. The players will have a different map views and features according to their role in the game.</p>
    <p>We had weekly meetings with the Overflow team to keep track of the project. I made wireframes with Figma and the logo with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
    <p>Design methods used during the project included research, facilitating workshops, user interviewing, usability testing, logo design, UI/UX design and prototyping solutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h2 class="title">Results</h2>
    <p>The project turned out to be bigger than initially thought. Since WIMMA Lab only last for a few months, it was not enough to finish everything. The phone tracker was working and the desktop system was partly done, but not all views were completed.</p>
    <p>Overall, all agreed goals with the client were achieved.</p>
